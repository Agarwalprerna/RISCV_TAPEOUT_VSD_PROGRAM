This work discusses the different aspects of designing a small SoC based on RVMYTH (a RISCV-based processor). This SoC will leverage a PLL as its clock generator and controller and a 10-bit DAC as a way to talk to the outside world. Other electrical devices with proper analog input like televisions, and mobile phones could manipulate DAC output and provide users with music sound or video frames. At the end of the day, it is possible to use this small fully open-source and well-documented SoC which has been fabricated under Sky130 technology, for educational purposes.


## Project Structure
- `src/include/` - Contains header files (`*.vh`) with necessary macros or parameter definitions.
- `src/module/` - Contains Verilog files for each module in the SoC design.
- `output/` - Directory where compiled outputs and simulation files will be generated.


1. **Initialization and Clock Generation**: Upon receiving an initial input signal, BabySoC activates the PLL. The PLL generates a stable and synchronized clock signal, which is essential for coordinating the activities of the RVMYTH processor and DAC. By synchronizing the system, the PLL ensures that all components operate in harmony, avoiding timing mismatches and ensuring data integrity.

2. **Data Processing in RVMYTH**: Within BabySoC, RVMYTH plays a central role in processing data. Specifically, it utilizes its `r17` register to hold and cycle through values that are used by the DAC. As RVMYTH executes instructions, it sequentially updates `r17` with new data, preparing it for analog conversion. This cyclical processing allows BabySoC to generate continuous data streams that the DAC can output.

3. **Analog Signal Generation via DAC**: The DAC receives the processed digital values from RVMYTH and converts them into an analog signal. This output, saved in a file named `OUT`, can be fed to external devices like TVs and mobile phones, which interpret the analog signals to produce sound or video. This functionality enables BabySoC to interface with consumer electronics, showcasing how digital data can drive multimedia outputs in real-world applications.
